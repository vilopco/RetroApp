# RetroApp

Is being developed using React + Nodejs + Express + MongoDB (Mongoose) + Bootstrap + SocketIO

Works as https://funretro.io or better :D

## Install

```bash
at client -> npm install
at server -> npm install
at root directory -> npm install && npm start
```

## Known Issues

Drag and Drop (card states) need to be working as promises, no SocketIO at this functionality. (In develop)

Showing comments are related to card state, not user actions state.

Edit comments and cards are missing.
